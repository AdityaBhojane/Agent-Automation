#  Prompt-Driven Automation Agent

This project is a lightweight automation agent powered by [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), designed to perform browser-based tasks like form filling, clicking buttons, and navigating websites—all triggered by a simple prompt.

## 🚀 Features

- ✍️ **Prompt-based control**: Just describe the task in code, and the agent executes it.
- 🌐 **Browser automation**: Uses Playwright to interact with real web pages.
- 🧩 **Extensible**: Easily add new task types or prompt handlers.
- 🛠️ **Minimal setup**: No complex configs—just write your prompt and run.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone 'repo url'
cd 'folder name'
npm install
# write your prompt into function 
node index.js
```
